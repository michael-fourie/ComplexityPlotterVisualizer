# ComplexityPlotterVisualizer
This is a visualizer for the complexity of various different searching and sorting algorithms. The project is built in Python, and uses matplotlib to plot results.

##  How it works
The following searching and sorting algorithm complexites are graphed and compared with similar functions: 
  Binary Search
  Linear Search
  Bubble Sort
  Optimized Bubble Sort
  Insertion Sort
  Selection Sort
Here is an image of all plotted complexities.
